    <h6 style="color: green; ">THE BEAR</h6> 

CHARACTERS<br>
<br>
   ELENA IVANOVNA POPOVA, a landowning little widow, with dimples on her
   cheeks<br>
   GRIGORY STEPANOVITCH SMIRNOV, a middle-aged landowner<br>
   LUKA, Popova's aged footman<br>


<p style="color:red" class="direction">[A drawing-room in POPOVA'S house.]</p>

<p style="color:red" class="direction">[POPOVA is in deep mourning and has her eyes fixed on a photograph. LUKA
is haranguing her.]</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6>
<p class="speech">It isn't right, madam.... You're just destroying yourself. The
maid and the cook have gone off fruit picking, every living being is
rejoicing, even the cat understands how to enjoy herself and walks about
in the yard, catching midges; only you sit in this room all day, as if
this was a convent, and don't take any pleasure. Yes, really! I reckon
it's a whole year that you haven't left the house!</p>

<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6>
<p>I shall never go out.... Why should I? My life is already at an
end. He is in his grave, and I have buried myself between four walls....
We are both dead.</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6>
<p>Well, there you are! Nicolai Mihailovitch is dead, well, it's the
will of God, and may his soul rest in peace.... You've mourned him--and
quite right. But you can't go on weeping and wearing mourning for ever.
My old woman died too, when her time came. Well? I grieved over her, I
wept for a month, and that's enough for her, but if I've got to weep
for a whole age, well, the old woman isn't worth it.You've
forgotten all your neighbours. You don't go anywhere, and you see
nobody. We live, so to speak, like spiders, and never see the light.
The mice have eaten my livery. It isn't as if there were no good people
around, for the district's full of them. There's a regiment quartered at
Riblov, and the officers are such beauties--you can never gaze your fill
at them. And, every Friday, there's a ball at the camp, and every day
the soldier's band plays.... Eh, my lady! You're young and beautiful,
with roses in your cheek--if you only took a little pleasure. Beauty
won't last long, you know. In ten years' time you'll want to be a
pea-hen yourself among the officers, but they won't look at you, it will
be too late.</p>

<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[With determination]</p>
<p>I must ask you never to talk to me about
it! You know that when Nicolai Mihailovitch died, life lost all its
meaning for me. I vowed never to the end of my days to cease to wear
mourning, or to see the light.... You hear? Let his ghost see how well I
love him.... Yes, I know it's no secret to you that he was often unfair
to me, cruel, and... and even unfaithful, but I shall be true till
death, and show him how I can love. There, beyond the grave, he will see
me as I was before his death....</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6>
<p>Instead of talking like that you ought to go and have a walk in
the garden, or else order Toby or Giant to be harnessed, and then drive
out to see some of the neighbours.</p>

<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6> Oh!<p style="color:red" class="direction">[Weeps.]</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6>
<p>Madam! Dear madam! What is it? Bless you!</p>

<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6>
<p>He was so fond of Toby! He always used to ride on him to the
Korchagins and Vlasovs. How well he could ride! What grace there was
in his figure when he pulled at the reins with all his strength! Do you
remember? Toby, Toby! Tell them to give him an extra feed of oats.</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6>
<p>Yes, madam.</p><p style="color:red" class="direction">[A bell rings noisily.]</p>

<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Shaking]</p><p>Who's that? Tell them that I receive nobody.</p>

<h6 class="LUKA"><b>LUKA.</b></h6> Yes, madam.<p style="color:red" class="direction">[Exit.]</p>
<h6 class="POPOVA"><b>POPOVA.</b></h6><p style="color:red" class="direction">[Looks at the photograph]</p> <p>You will see, Nicolas, how I can love
and forgive.... My love will die out with me, only when this poor heart</p>
will cease to beat.<p style="color:red" class="direction">[Laughs through her tears]</p> <p>And aren't you ashamed?
I am a good and virtuous little wife. I've locked myself in, and will
be true to you till the grave, and you... aren't you ashamed, you bad
child? You deceived me, had rows with me, left me alone for weeks on
end....</p>
